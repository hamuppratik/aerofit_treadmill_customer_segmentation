Aerofit Customer Segmentation with Insights and Recommendations:

In this project, I conducted an in-depth customer analysis for Aerofit, examining demographics and behavior patterns across various treadmill models. I
utilized a range of statistical techniques, including Correlation, Univariate, Bivariate, and Multivariate analysis, as well as Conditional Probabilities, 
to identify key insights and segment customer groups effectively. The analysis uncovered a notable gender preference for treadmills, with 53.7% of customers b
eing male and 42.3% female. It also revealed that younger customers (aged 21-30) favored the 'KP281' model, while budget-conscious customers 
(with an income below $60,000) tended to choose the 'KP281' and 'KP481' models. These insights were used to optimize targeted marketing strategies.
